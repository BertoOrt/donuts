# Don't Take The Last Donut!!

Why don't we want to take the last donut? Doesn't the scarcity principle tell us that we place more value on an item that is scarce? If that's the case, shouldn't we be fighting for the last donut instead?

The thought is that we are altruistic and want to leave the best for others.

In this game, be extra nice and leave the opponent with one donut.

### Instructions

This is a two player, turn based game.

In each game, the donuts are grouped into three horizontal rows.

You play by taking turns at removing the donuts from the game. On a turn you may remove as many donuts as you like from any one row.

The person who leaves the last donut for the other player to take is the winner.
